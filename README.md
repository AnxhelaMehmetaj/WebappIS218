Contributed Anxhela Mehmetaj 

DESCRIPTION

An application that allows user(s) to log onto their account, or go through
the registration process that requires an email verification to sign up. 
Afterwards, the page will load to their personal calendar display that shows
the events transferred from the user(s)' Google Calendar. There will be a 
clickable button in the top, left corner that will open their Google Calendar 
in another window where they may add/remove more events.

FEATURES

LOGIN/REGISTRATION

Allows user(s) to create a new login account. If the user(s) already has an account, they can 
log on to access their page. If the email is taken once they cannot register with the same email.

CALENDAR DISPLAY

Allows user(s) to see the events on their own personal calendar page. The events are
transferred from their Google Calendar.
